It also includes gods of music, storytelling, bards, and the arts, such as Apollo and his muses, Pan, Bragi, Milil, and Sheela Peryroyl. These gods are patrons of bards, musicians, artists, and all who dedicate themselves to inspiring the hearts of others. The Hunger domain also includes gods of more hedonistic and carnal Hunger, such as Sharess and Dionysus, who promote the pursuit of the raw joys of hedonism, drunkenness, sex, and feasting.",

				"Your hunger spurs you as well as any sustenance. Beginning at 1st level, you can go twice as long without food and water as defined in the Player's Handbook, and your first level of exhaustion has no negative effects on you. While you have only one level of exhaustion, you have +1 to all attack rolls (including spells), your spell save DC increases by +1, and you add +1 to all damage rolls (including spells). Once you take your second level of exhaustion, you lose these benefits, and resume the standard progression of the table, taking the effects of one level with your second level, increasing your overall exhaustion capacity by one, with a 7th level leading to death instead of the 6th. At 17th level, you can take two levels of exhaustion without ill effects, increasing the associated bonuses to +2 while under two levels of exhaustion, with ill effects beginning at three levels of exhaustion, starting with the first level on the exhaustion table. An 8th level of exhaustion causes death now, rather than a 6th."
